# Using EEG Data to Explore Emotional Determinants of Physical Activity Motivation

Motivating individuals to engage in regular physical activity is a critical public health challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and data science. This repository introduces a novel framework to analyze the emotional determinants of physical activity motivation by leveraging **electroencephalogram (EEG)** data and advanced machine learning models.

The proposed method integrates a **Motivational Dynamics Network (MDN)**, a deep learning architecture designed to model complex temporal relationships between motivational factors and activity levels, with the **Dynamic Motivation Optimization Strategy (DMOS)**, which enhances adaptive personalization and real-time contextual feedback using reinforcement learning.

## Features

### Motivational Dynamics Network (MDN)
- **Temporal Modeling:** Captures dynamic, time-varying relationships between intrinsic (emotional/cognitive) and extrinsic (social/contextual) motivators.
- **EEG Signal Integration:** Analyzes neural data to extract intrinsic motivators linked to emotional and cognitive states.
- **Contextual Insights:** Incorporates external data, such as social and environmental dynamics, to model extrinsic motivators.

### Dynamic Motivation Optimization Strategy (DMOS)
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Provides real-time feedback and adaptive personalization to optimize motivation.
- **Actionable Insights:** Generates personalized strategies to sustain engagement in physical activity.
- **Context-Aware Adaptation:** Responds to real-world changes in user behavior and environment.

### Key Benefits
- Improved **prediction of physical activity engagement** compared to baseline models.
- Advanced **personalization of intervention strategies** using EEG and behavioral data.
- New insights into the dynamic interplay of **emotional, social, and contextual factors** in motivation.

## Experiments and Results
- **Prediction Accuracy:** Experimental results show significant improvement in predicting physical activity engagement using the MDN and DMOS framework.
- **Personalization Success:** Demonstrated the ability to deliver personalized, effective intervention strategies based on real-time EEG and contextual data.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Revealed critical emotional determinants of physical activity motivation, advancing understanding of neural and behavioral interactions.
